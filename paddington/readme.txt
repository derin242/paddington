[!] It is highly recommended to run the python file in VSCode.

Run the python file first, and while it's running you can use the extension.

Importing the extension to firefox:
1. Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-On..."
3. Select the manifest.json file located in Paddington/extension/manifest.json
4. You're all set, enjoy!
